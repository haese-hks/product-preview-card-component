### Overview

This is my solution to the Product Preview Card Component challenge from Frontend Mentor. The project features a responsive product card with an image, title, description, price, and a call-to-action button, designed for both mobile and desktop views using CSS Flexbox and Media Queries.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
